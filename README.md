# Angular 2 - Intro

In this workshop we'll be building an Angular 2 app "El Menon de Oro" that allow users to:

* Give menon de oro to any Menon 
* Remove menon de oro from any menon who was one
* See all the menones that won menon de oro en el pasado

# The Angular CLI

One of the easiest ways start a new Angular 2 application is to use the brand new Angular command-line interface (CLI) 
that allows you to create an application that already works, right out of the box and that follows the best practices.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.9.

## Install it!
To install angular CLI run the following in the terminal:
```bash
$ npm install -g angular-cli
```

##Generating our **Menon de Oro** app
```bash
$ ng new menon-de-oro
```
This will create a new directory for us with all the resources that we need to get started!

**Navigate to the new directory:**

```bash
$ cd menon-de-oro
```

Now, let's **start the dev server** with the followign command:
```bash
$ ng serve
```
**Awesome right?**
